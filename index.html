    <div class="story">Sasuke confronted his brother Itachi, who had massacred their family. They fiercely battled, with Sasuke believing he had defeated Itachi using a lightning-charged Kirin jutsu. However, Itachi's "death" was an illusion meant to advance Sasuke's Sharingan. The real battle ended with Itachi taking Sasuke's eyes, hinting at a tragic Uchiha destiny where siblings are fated to fight and usurp each other's powers.
